## ü§ù Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Early-Generate-Random-Games**!  
The project is currently in active development, so here's how to collaborate safely.

### Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature
   ```
2. **Make your changes**
    - Implement your feature or fix.
    - Test locally if possible.

3. **Push your branch**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-feature
   ```
4. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**
   - Base branch: develop (or another non-protected branch).
   - Provide a clear description of your changes.

5. **Review and Merge**
   - At least one approving review from a contributor with write access is required.
   - After approval, the PR can be merged into the target branch.

**Branch Rules**
 - Main and develop are protected.
 - Direct pushes to these branches are restricted.
 - Use feature branches for all new work.

**Notes**
 - Keep commits clean and descriptive.
 - Use small, focused PRs whenever possible.
 - CI/status checks (if enabled) must pass before merging.
